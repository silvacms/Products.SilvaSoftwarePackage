SilvaSoftwarePackage changes

  0.4

    Bugs fixed:

      * Installation will now create a service_software automatically.

      * It's no longer possible to add SilvaSoftwareFiles to 
        SilvaSoftwarePackage objects.

    Features added:

      * The filenames are now shown in the SilvaSoftwarePackage views, not
        only from SilvaSoftwareRelease (less clicking for the client).

      * Instead of filling in an id, title and version, only the version can
        be filled in when a client creates a SilvaSoftwareRelease, this version
        is also used as id and to generate nice looking titles.
