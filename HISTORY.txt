SilvaSoftwarePackage changes

  1.0.1

    Features added:

    - Set the addable priority to -9 so SilvaSoftwareFile is the first item,
      thus less likely to be confused with SilvaFile which doesn't show up.

    Bugs fixed:

    - changed to work with ExtFile 2.0.2

    - edit.pt has been replaced with tab_edit.pt as described in developers.txt

    - fix for error that was raised when using ZODB storage

  1.0

    Bugs fixed:

    - made Silva 2.0 compliant

  0.6

    Features added:

    - Changed the listing date from get_public_version_publication_datetime
      to get_creation_datetime because a republish changes the 'Release Date'.

    - Up the addable_priority to 9, so these (probably) Infrae-only products
      appear last in the list, leaving room for other parties in between

  0.5

    Features added:

    - Tweaked the icon to differentiate it from a S3PSPackage, so nobody
      mistakenly adds the wrong type.

    - Removed the tab_metadata file, thereby adding features!

    - Now works with zope3 style interfaces.

  0.4

    Bugs fixed:

      - Installation will now create a service_software automatically.

      - It's no longer possible to add SilvaSoftwareFiles to
        SilvaSoftwarePackage objects.

    Features added:

      - The filenames are now shown in the SilvaSoftwarePackage views, not
        only from SilvaSoftwareRelease (less clicking for the client).

      - Instead of filling in an id, title and version, only the version can
        be filled in when a client creates a SilvaSoftwareRelease, this version
        is also used as id and to generate nice looking titles.

      - Paths are now sorted alphabetically in the stats tab of the
        SilvaSoftwareService.
