SilvaSoftwarePackage changes

  0.5 unreleased

    Features added:

    - Tweaked the icon to differentiate it from a S3PSPackage, so nobody
      mistakenly adds the wrong type.

    - Removed the tab_metadata file, thereby adding features!

    - Now works with zope3 style interfaces.

  0.4

    Bugs fixed:

      - Installation will now create a service_software automatically.

      - It's no longer possible to add SilvaSoftwareFiles to 
        SilvaSoftwarePackage objects.

    Features added:

      - The filenames are now shown in the SilvaSoftwarePackage views, not
        only from SilvaSoftwareRelease (less clicking for the client).

      - Instead of filling in an id, title and version, only the version can
        be filled in when a client creates a SilvaSoftwareRelease, this version
        is also used as id and to generate nice looking titles.

      - Paths are now sorted alphabetically in the stats tab of the 
        SilvaSoftwareService.
