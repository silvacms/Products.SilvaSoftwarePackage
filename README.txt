Introduction
============

This is a Silva extension product that provides a small set of objects to present software releases to the public. There are two main objects: SilvaSoftwarePackage and SilvaSoftwareRelease. SilvaSoftwarePackage is a container that can (only) contain SilvaSoftwareReleases, SilvaDocument objects and Asset objects. There's an 'index' document to provide some description about the software package, the public view will show this index together with an ordered (by version) list of SilvaSoftwareReleases contained in the SilvaSoftwarePackage. SilvaSoftwareRelease is also a container object, but instead it can only contain Document objects and Asset objects. There's also an index document that will be displayed on public view, here some changelog and such can be displayed, together with the File Asset objects contained in the SilvaSoftwareRelease.
